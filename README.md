# Cotton Box

This project provides a site where potential and returning customers are able to browse and potentially buy the designer Korean clothing that are available. This is done by providing a modern website that is not only well designed but is also easy to navigate.

## UX

### User Stories

1. As a **new customer**, when I load the landing page, I would like to see that it contains a link for each of the different categories of clothing available, so that I am able to quickly view all items of the desired category.

- **Acceptance Criteria**

- Given that I am a new customer, when I go to the landing page, the website will show me the different categories of clothing available. When I click on each of the 'cards' it will take me to the corresponding page.

2. As a **new customer**, I would like to go to the 'About Us' page, so that I can find out more information about the store/company such as the history and where the store/company is located.
