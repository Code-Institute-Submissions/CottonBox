# Cotton Box

This project provides a site where potential and returning customers are able to browse and potentially buy the designer Korean clothing that are available. This is done by providing a modern website that is not only well designed but is also easy to navigate.

## UX

### User Stories

1. As a **new customer**, when I load the landing page, I would like to see that it contains a link for each of the different categories of clothing available, so that I am able to quickly view all items of the desired category.

- **Acceptance Criteria**

- Given that I am a new customer, when I go to the landing page, the website will show me the different categories of clothing available. When I click on each of the 'cards' it will take me to the corresponding page.

- The wireframes for this can be found [here](wireframes/wireframes.pdf).

2. As a **new customer**, I would like to go to the 'About Us' page, so that I can find out more information about the store/company such as the history and where the store/company is located.

- **Acceptance Criteria**

- Given that I am a new customer, when I go to the ‘About Us’ page, the website should provide me all of the information about the store/company and there should be a map with the location of the store/company.

- The wireframes for this can be found [here](wireframes/wireframes.pdf).

3. As a **Mandarin speaking customer**, I would like to change the language of the content, so that I am able to understand the site easier and to navigate the site more easily.

- **Acceptance Criteria**

- Given that I am a mandarin speaking customer, when I go to the website and I select the flag that represents my language from the dropdown menu, the language of the website will change to the selected language.

4. As a **new/existing customer**, I would like to go to the ‘Contact Us’ page and fill out the form, so that I am able to send a message to the company about general questions or problems that I am having.

- The wireframes for this can be found [here](wireframes/wireframes.pdf).

5. As a **new/existing customer**, I would like to search to search for an item, so that I am able to quickly find all of the relevant items of clothing I am looking for.

## Features

During the development of the project, I have created seperate branches for each of the features that I have implemented. This was done to preserve the stability of the master branch.

### Existing Features

1. #### Header

   Allows users to quickly and easy navigate to different pages and to search for products. On tablet and mobile, the user will have to press the menu button to display the navigation and search bar.

   Also allows users to switch between different languages from the language dropdown.

3. #### New-in Section

   Notifies the user of recently added items of clothing and provides them a link to the page where they can view the item.

4. #### Categories Section

5. #### Footer

   Allows the user to quickly and easily navigate to different pages and provides additional links such as the sitemap and social media that are not available in the header.

   This allows the users to view more information about the company such as when it was founded, what the company does and where to find them.
